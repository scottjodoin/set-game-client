# Set in your browser!

This is a simple client-side version of Set. I made it because I wanted to know if I was in fact adding three cards when there were no sets available.

## Buttons

Reset: Resets the game

Add 3: IF there are no Sets on the table, then the game will add three cards.

Hint: If you are struggling to find a set, the game will highlight a card in a set in pink. Keep clicking for more hints. Clicker be warned! Each click will add to your hint count for the game.
